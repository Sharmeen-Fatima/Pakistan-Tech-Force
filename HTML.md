## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

### **1 What is HTML?**

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.
It is the **standard language** used to **create and design web pages**.

HTML tells the web browser **how to display text, images, links, and other content** on a webpage.

Think of HTML as the **skeleton of a website** â€” it gives structure to the content.

### **2 The History of HTML**

HTML was first developed in **1991** by **Tim Berners-Lee**, who also created the World Wide Web.

* In the beginning, HTML was very **simple**, with just a few tags.
* Over time, it has gone through many **versions and updates**.
* The latest major version is **HTML5**, which was officially released in **2014**.
* HTML5 includes many new features like **audio, video, forms, and graphics**, making web pages more interactive.

So, HTML has **grown and improved** to meet the needs of modern websites.

### **3 What are Tags and Attributes?**

#### **Tags:**

Tags are the **building blocks of HTML**.
They are used to **mark or define** different parts of a web page, like headings, paragraphs, images, or links.

Tags are written inside **angle brackets**, like this: `<p>` for a paragraph.

Example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Here, `<p>` is the opening tag, and `</p>` is the closing tag.

#### **Attributes:**

Attributes give **extra information** about an HTML element.
They are always written **inside the opening tag**.

Example:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful view">
```

In this example:

* `src` is an attribute that tells the browser **where the image is located**
* `alt` is an attribute that describes the **image content**

So, tags define the content, and attributes give **details or settings** for that content.
